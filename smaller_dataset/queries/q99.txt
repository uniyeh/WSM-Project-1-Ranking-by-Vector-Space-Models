This paper notes the benefits accruing from interaction between computerized retrieval systems and micrographic retrieval systems.  It reviews current state of automated micrographic retrieval technology.  The conclusion is that with a combination of advances in communications technology, and sophisticated indexing input from libraries and information scientists, the new generation of automated micrographs devices may constitute the on-line document retrieval systems of the future.
