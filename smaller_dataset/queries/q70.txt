A new method is described to extract significant phrases in the title and the abstreact of scientific or technical documents.  The method is based upon a text structure analysis and uses a relatively small dictionary. The dictionary has been constructed based on the knowledge about concepts in the field of science or technology and some lexical knowledge.  For significant phrases and their component items may be used in different meanings among the fields.  A text analysius approach has been applied to select significant phrases as substantial and semantic information carriers of the contents of the abstract.  The results of the experiment for five sets of documents have shown that the significant phrases are effectively extracted in all cases, and the number of them for every document and the processing time is fairly satisfactory.  The information representation of the document, partly using the method, is discussed with relation to the construction of the document information retrieval system.
