Current online library network technology is described, including the physical and functional aspects of networks.  Three types of networks are distinguished:  search service (e.g., SDC, Lockheed), customized service that provide bibliographic files (e.g., OCLC, Inc., RLIN), and service center (e.g., NELINET, INCOLSA).  It is predicted that as technology evolves more services will be provided outside the library directly to the user through his home or office.
