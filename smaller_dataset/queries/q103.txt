This paper tackles the problem of how one might select further search terms, using relevance feedback, given the search terms in the query.  These search terms are extracted from a maximum spanning tree connecting all the terms in the index term vocabulary.  A number of different spanning trees are generated from a variety of association measures.  The retrieval effectiveness for the different spanning trees is shown to be approximately the same.  Effectiveness is measured in terms of precision and recall, and the retrieval tests are done on three different test collections.
