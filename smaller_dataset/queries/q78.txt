Algorithms are given to process partially specified queries in a compressed database system.  The proposed methods handle effectively queries that use either whole words or word fragments as language elements. The methods are compared and critically evaluated in terms of the design and retrieval costs.  The analyses show that the method which exploits the interdependence of fragments as well as the relevance of fragments to records in the file has maximum design cost and least retrieval cost.
