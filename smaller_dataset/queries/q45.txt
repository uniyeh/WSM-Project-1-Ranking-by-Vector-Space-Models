I am seeking information on the use of data processing in libraries and the mechanization of routine library processes and procedures.  I would like descriptions of both general and specific applications of automation in such areas as circulation, cataloging, acquisitions, serial records, and other record-keeping.  Examples should be based on the operation of a conventional public or university library, or practices in a special library which could also be applied in a public or university library.  Give descriptions of equipment and operations, both present and projected.
