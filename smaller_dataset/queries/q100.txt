Conventional information retrieval processes are largely based on data movement, pointer manipulations and integer arithmetic; more refined retrieval algorithms may in addition benefit from substantial computational power.  In the present study a number of parallel processing methods are described that serve to enhance retrieval services.  In conventional retrieval environments parallel list processing and parallel search facilities are of greatest interest.  In more advanced systems, the use of array processors also proves beneficial.  Various information retrieval processes are examined and evidence is given to demonstrate the usefulness of parallel processing and fast computational facilities in information retrieval.
