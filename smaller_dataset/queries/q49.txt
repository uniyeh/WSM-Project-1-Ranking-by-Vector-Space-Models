Is there any use for traditional classification schemes - DDC, UDC, LC, etc. - in information retrieval systems?  If there is, which scheme appears most suited to machine use and where has it been applied? If there is not, why are these classification schemes irrelevant? Has research shown that a subject classification of knowledge is completely unnecessary in machine systems? Or, have new schemes been devised which appear to be more suited to machine use?
