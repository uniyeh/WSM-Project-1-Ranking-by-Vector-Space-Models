Time to talk defense The Asia-Pacific region is home to some of the world's hottest flash points, yet security discussions remain woefully ad hoc. There is no regular dialogue forum for regional defense officials, and when leaders do get together, security issues rank second to economic issues. That may change after last weekend's defense summit in Singapore. The Shangri-La Dialogue (named after the hotel in which the meetings were held) is intended to lay the groundwork for a regular discussion of security concerns among the region's defense policymakers. It is long overdue.
