Marketing matters in foreign policy HONOLULU -- Call me a cynic, but I've long believed that one of the greatest foreign-policy advantages the United States has enjoyed is the ineptness of the governments it has confronted. It's always good to have right on your side, but sometimes that isn't enough. Nor is might the answer: The reality of the post-Cold War diplomatic world is that unilateralism just isn't tenable, even for the world's remaining superpower. Washington's decision to pursue Iraq through the United Nations is proof of that.
