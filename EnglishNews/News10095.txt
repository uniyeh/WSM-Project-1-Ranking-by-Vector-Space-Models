Koizumi must now master global politics LOS ANGELES -- I met Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi two years ago for a fascinating interview. I recall slightly pressing him on the touchy question of whether Japan would actually overcome its restrictive pacifist Constitution (a significant legacy of the U.S. Occupation) and dispatch troops to Iraq, which would prove a symbolic and groundbreaking move. Many doubted that Japan would ever do this, but Koizumi insisted to me that he would.
