Busy year for Japan as APEC chair Japan formally took up the chairmanship of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum for 2010 on Monday as senior officials from the 21 member economies gathered in Hiroshima to discuss free trade and investment in the region.
The two days of talks come ahead of a series of APEC ministerial meetings during the year and are centering on preparatory dialogues to lay the groundwork for APEC leaders to issue an annual joint statement at their summit in November in Yokohama.
