Asian activists slam revote on sex slave resolution Female Asian activists on Saturday denounced a planned revote on a Philippine House of Representatives resolution that called on Japan to formally apologize for its role in forcing close to 200 Filipino women to work as sex slaves in World War II and to compensate the victims.
Activists from Taiwan, Indonesia, North and South Korea, Japan, China and the Philippines, as well as the Netherlands — all members of the International Solidarity Council for Redress of WWII Victims by Japan, or ISCR — told a news conference in Manila the move smacks of "dirty play" and buckling under pressure from Japan.
