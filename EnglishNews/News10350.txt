Japan-China mind games HONOLULU -- Two weeks in China have left me concerned about future relations between Japan and China. A smooth and cooperative Japan-China relationship is essential to regional peace, stability and prosperity. Yet increasing interaction at just about every level of the relationship has generated many irritants. I'm not sure that increased contact between the two countries will create the understanding needed to improve that relationship, but increasing integration will help. As in a boxing match, it's harder to punch while in the opponent's clinch.
