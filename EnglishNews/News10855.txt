Imano wins back-to-back Yasuharu Imano survived a shaky back nine to win the Aiful Cup and secure back-to-back titles after a final level-par round of 72 on Sunday.
Imano, who won the NST Niigata Open last week, led the tournament from the opening day but dropped two shots in the last six holes and finished just one stroke ahead of Toshimitsu Izawa on a 20-under total of 268.
