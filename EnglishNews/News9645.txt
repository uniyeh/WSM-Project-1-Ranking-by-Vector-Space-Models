Lee's Yasukuni visit disappointing 
Regarding the June 8 article "Lee courts discord with Yasukuni visit": Lee Teng-hui was regarded as a democracy advocate during his years as Taiwan's president.

But his June 7 visit to Yasukuni Shrine (to offer a prayer for his brother who died while fighting for Japan in World War II) shamed many of us Taiwanese and other Asians.
