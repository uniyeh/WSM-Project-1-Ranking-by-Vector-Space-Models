Chand grabs lead after first round Fijian Dinesh Chand got off to a solid start Thursday, taking a one-stroke lead atop the leaderboard after firing 4-under-par 67 in the first round of the Japan Open. Chand made five birdies with his only blotch of the scorecard coming with a bogey on the par-4 11th hole to move one shot ahead of Kenichi Kuboya and Taiwan's Lin Keng-chi at Hirono Golf Club. Meanwhile, Masashi "Jumbo" Ozaki and veterans Isao Aoki and Tsuneyuki Nakajima each had disappointing results on the first day of the four-day event after being paired in the same group.
