A 'liberal' disposition for creating wealth MANILA -- Often I begin workshops or classes dealing with liberalism by asking participants to share their definition of that political concept by jotting catchwords on little cards that are then collected and pinned to a moderation board. Not only is this method, as I have come to learn, highly participatory, but it also comes close to a written referendum of the group on the definition of a highly complex and controversial concept.
