Test for Taiwan's judiciary Mr. Chen Shui-bian, an advocate of pro-independence policies vis-a-vis China, symbolized the democratization of Taiwan by winning a presidential election in March 2000. His victory ended the monopoly rule of the Nationalist Party, which opposes any moves to formally declare Taiwan's independence. He served two terms as Taiwan's president until May 2008. His arrest this week on suspicion of corruption is a political blow to the Democratic Progressive Party, which Mr. Chen had led.
