Beijing's 'internal affairs' HONG KONG â€” Ever since the 1950s, China has subscribed to the principle of noninterference in the internal affairs of other countries, which was first written into a treaty that it signed with India in 1954. China has loudly upheld this principle and criticized those who, in Beijing's view, interfere in its internal affairs, including those who comment on its human rights record.
