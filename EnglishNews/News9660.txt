No breakthrough with Beijing in gas rights talks China did not make any formal proposals Friday on how to resolve its dispute with Japan over gas exploration rights in the East China Sea, despite signs it was willing to do so, Japan's delegate to the one-day meeting said.
But the two sides reached a "better understanding" after their discussions and plan to meet more often to try to reach a solution, said Kenichiro Sasae, head of the Foreign Ministry's Asian and Oceanian Affairs Bureau.
