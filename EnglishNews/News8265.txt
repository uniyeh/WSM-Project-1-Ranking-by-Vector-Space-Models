Intensify diplomatic efforts with Iran The sanctions against Iran for its nuclear program that the United States announced in December went into force on Thursday. The European Union stepped up its embargo on oil imports from Iran on Sunday. When the U.S. and the EU first announced the sanctions in December, Iran threatened to block the Hormuz straight, a key oil route. The U.S. demonstrated its power by sending an aircraft carrier through the strait. It is vital that both sides exhibit self-restraint and resolve their differences through diplomatic means.
