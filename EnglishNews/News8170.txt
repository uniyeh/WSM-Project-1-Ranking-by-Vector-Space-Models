Future war fiction — also known as alternate history or military science fiction — has been around a long time. Occasionally such books have proved startlingly prophetic. Sinclair Gluck's "The Dragon in Harness" (1932) featured a Japanese surprise attack on Pearl Harbor nine years before the actual event. In general, however, it must be understood that such books are, after all, fiction and plausibility need not be a critical factor in judging their worth.
