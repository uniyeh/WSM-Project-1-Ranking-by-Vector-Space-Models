The transmutable Mr. Blair LONDON -- Prime Minister Tony Blair is back in London after his whirlwind tour of Northeast Asia. For many of us the high point of his tour were the delightful moments at Tsinghua University in Beijing when, following a range of predictable questions that he answered with the usual bromides, he was asked by a student to sing. Without any of his usual advisers on hand to tell him what to do (they had gone home), he turned to his wife, Cherie, and told her to sing instead. Quite. No advisers, no views.
