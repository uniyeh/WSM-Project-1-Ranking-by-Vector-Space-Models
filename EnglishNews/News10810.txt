Japan owns Senkaku isles: Taiwan's Lee Former Taiwan President Lee Teng-hui has said the Senkaku Islands, which are Japanese-controlled but claimed by Taiwan and China, actually belong to Japan.
"The land of the Senkaku Islands belongs to Okinawa, therefore it is a territory of Japan," Lee said, according to an interview carried in the Okinawa Times on Tuesday. "There is no evidence for China's territorial claim, no matter what it says." It is not clear which international law China's claim is based on."
