Hsia Yu: modern, universal and refreshing FUSION KITSCH: Poetry by Hsia Yu, Translated by Steve Bradbury. Zephyr Press, Massachusetts, 2001, 131 pp., $13 (paper)
The title of this book, the first bilingual collection of work by Taiwanese poet Hsia Yu, is apt. In fact, translator Steve Bradbury, a professor at National Central University in Taiwan, says that what first drew him to Yu's poetry was that it was both "very Chinese and refreshingly cosmopolitan." For most poets writing in Chinese, these are necessarily contradictory conditions. The desire to affirm a cultural or national identity in the face of increasing Western influence is strong. But Yu, who lives in France, apparently doesn't grapple too hard with this problem. One of the first woman poets writing in Chinese to have broken dramatically from the conventions and constraints of traditional Chinese poetry, she's just as happy among the mysteries of Paris as in the warrens of her native Taipei.
