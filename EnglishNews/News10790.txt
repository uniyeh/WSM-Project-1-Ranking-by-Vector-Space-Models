Texas hospitality for Mr. Jiang Chinese President Jiang Zemin is visiting the United States. The high point of the trip is a stop at President George W. Bush's Crawford, Texas, ranch, where the two men will indulge in summit rituals. The presidents will probably spend more time eating barbecue and posing for photographs than they will talk business. Nonetheless, the summit is important: There are pressing issues on the agenda. More significant, the meeting will help keep the Sino-U.S. relationship on its current trajectory. After a difficult start, bilateral relations between the two countries are as good as they have ever been. The challenge is maintaining that positive relationship as the two countries grapple with important international issues.
