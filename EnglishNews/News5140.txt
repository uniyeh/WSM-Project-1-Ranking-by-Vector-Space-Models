'You Are the Apple of My Eye': A missed chance at romance isn't a bad thing "You Are the Apple of My Eye," a teen romance by writer and director Giddens Ko in 2011, became a hit not only in his native Taiwan but across Asia. Seeing it at the Udine Far East Film Festival, I was struck by the raunchiness of the humor, starting with a classroom masturbation contest, and the originality of the story, which was based on Ko's semi-autobiographical novel about his long, on-again/off-again relationship with a cute, hard-working high school classmate. "Only in Taiwan," I thought.
