No loss for words when expressing scale of DPJ's defeat December's election aftermath offered a good chance to learn synonyms for "crushing defeat" and "overwhelming victory." Taihai (大敗, great defeat), kanpai (完敗, total defeat) — not to be confused with kanpai! (乾杯, cheers!) — kaimetsutekina haiboku (壊滅的な敗北, annihilating defeat), zanpai (惨敗, crushing defeat), rekishitekina haiboku (歴史的な敗北, historic defeat) on the one side; taisho (大勝, great victory); assho (圧勝, landslide) on the other. If defeat predominates in this list it's because the media tended to focus more on the incumbent's defeat than on the challenger's victory. As the Nihon Keizai Shimbun editorialized, "Jiminto ga taisho shita to iu yori, minshuto ga sanpai shita senkyo datta (自民党が大勝したというより、民主党が惨敗した選挙だった, Rather than a great victory for the Liberal Democratic Party [LDP], the election was a pitiful defeat for the Democratic Party of Japan [DPJ].")
