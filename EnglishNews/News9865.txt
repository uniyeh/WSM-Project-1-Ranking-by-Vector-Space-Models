Mogi gets some wiggle room Hiromi Mogi took a two-stroke lead over Mie Nakata and Taiwan's Lu Ya-Huei in the Meiji Chocolate Cup on Saturday after shooting a 4-under-par 68 in the second round.
Searching for her third career victory and first since the Munsingwear Ladies in September 2004, Mogi made five birdies against a bogey for a 7-under 137 total at Sapporo International Country Club's Shimamatsu Course.
