Tanihara captures 2nd title of season Hideto Tanihara survived a late scare on the back nine to capture his second title of the season with a final-round 72 at the Sun Chlorella Classic on Sunday.
Tanihara suffered back-to-back bogeys from the 16th at Otaru Country Club in Hokkaido but held his nerve to make a par-saving putt on the last and record a one-stroke victory over overnight leader Tetsuji Hiratsuka and four other players on 5-under 283.
