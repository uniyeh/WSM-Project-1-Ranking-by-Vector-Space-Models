Cross-strait ties leap ahead Cross-strait rapprochement leaped forward last week as Taiwan and China launched direct flights and cargo shipping services. These new links reflect the economic reality that binds the two sides of the strait: Annual trade between the island and the mainland is about $100 billion. Political issues have slowed these contacts, but these obstacles have diminished and cross-strait ties are rapidly expanding. This progress should be applauded as it calms a regional flash point and contributes to regional growth.
