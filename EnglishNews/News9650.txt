Aso defends Lee's visit to Yasukuni Japanese Foreign Minister Taro Aso said Sunday that he sees no problem with former Taiwan President Lee Teng-hui's visit Thursday to the war-linked Yasukuni Shrine in Tokyo, dismissing criticism from China about Lee's recent trip to Japan.
"Mr. Lee is 84 years old and has retired to private life," Aso said in a speech in Sendai, northeastern Japan. "His elder brother is honored at Yasukuni Shrine and I wonder what problem there is in his having visited it while he is still healthy."
