Singapore Airlines to halt Hiroshima flights Singapore Airlines said Wednesday it will suspend flights to Hiroshima for almost two months as it slashes an additional 60 flights per week due to weak demand for air travel.
"In response to softening demand due to the war in Iraq and the spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), Singapore Airlines will implement further service reductions in the coming weeks," the airline said in a statement.
