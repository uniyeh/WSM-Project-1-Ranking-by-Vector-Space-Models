Chinese intrude at Senkakus Two Chinese survey ships entered Japanese territorial waters on Monday morning in the East China Sea near the Japanese-administered Senkaku islets, which are also claimed by Taiwan and China, the Japan Coast Guard said.
Chief Cabinet Secretary Takeo Kawamura said Japan has lodged a protest with China against the "very regrettable" intrusion by the two survey ships.
