Sizing up America after Iraq SINGAPORE -- Three weeks into the war in Iraq, the main protagonists are already retooling their strategies for dealing with the United States. China, Russia, France, Germany, Britain, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, the Philippines and, lastly, North Korea (most likely the next target of American ire) have all begun analyzing the U.S.-led war in Iraq from both strategic and tactical points of view. In fact, the war in Iraq is as much about the U.S. role in the world tomorrow as whether Washington will play by the rules. Thus for many countries, contending with American power is perhaps more important than dealing with Iraq.
