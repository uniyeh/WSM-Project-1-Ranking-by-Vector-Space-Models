Sakai shuts out Greece on two hits Taeko Utsugi's women showed host Greece what they are made of Wednesday as Japan blanked Greece 6-0 for its second victory in Olympic softball after going down three times in the preliminaries at the Athens Games. Hiroko Sakai threw a two-hit shutout for Japan, which entered the game next-to-last in the eight-nation tournament despite coming to Athens hoping to improve on their silver finish in Sydney four years ago. It was Sakai's second shutout in four days since the 25-year-old right-hander pitched a two-hitter against Taiwan on Sunday.
