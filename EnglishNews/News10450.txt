U.S. to probe Teac over patents The U.S. International Trade Commission will launch an investigation into Teac Corp. and 11 other companies over alleged infringement of electronic device patents owned by two U.S. firms.
The investigation is based on complaints filed earlier this month by Zoran Corp. and its wholly owned subsidiary Oak Technology Inc., both of Sunnyvale, Calif., under section 337 of the U.S. Tariff Act of 1930.
