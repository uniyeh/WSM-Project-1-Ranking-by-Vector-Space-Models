Katayama triumphs Overnight leader Shingo Katayama claimed his first title of the season at the Chunichi Crowns on Sunday despite a lackluster 2-over-par 72 in the final round of the 120 million yen event.
Teeing off seven strokes clear of the pack, 2000 money rankings winner Katayama had three birdies against five bogeys in his worst round of the week at the par-70 Nagoya Golf Club but still managed to claim a two-stroke victory over Australian Paul Sheehan on 16-under 264.
