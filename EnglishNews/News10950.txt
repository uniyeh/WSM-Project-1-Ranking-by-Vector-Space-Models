Did NHK balk at covering war tribunal? It was indicated last week that the International Criminal Court, a permanent judicial body with the power to try individuals and groups accused of war crimes, genocide and crimes against humanity, will soon be formally established.

Cambodia, Ireland, Jordan and Romania have expressed their intention to ratify by July.
