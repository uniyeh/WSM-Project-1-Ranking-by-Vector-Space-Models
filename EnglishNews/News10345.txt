Landmark power transfer in China The resignation of Mr. Jiang Zemin as chairman of China's Central Military Commission (CMC), the country's top military post, completes the transfer of power from Mr. Jiang to his successor, Mr. Hu Jintao. The handover is a landmark in modern Chinese politics, but its political impact is unclear. Mr. Jiang's resignation is unlikely to herald any major shift in policy in Beijing. Nevertheless, China's new generation of leaders have fully grasped the reins of power and the very nature of that transition holds out hope for the future.
