Sumo touch down in Taiwan A group of sumo wrestlers arrived in Taiwan on Thursday for a five-day exhibition tour that will include the first matches of the ancient Japanese sport to be held in Taiwan since the end of World War II.
Local TV news footage showed that Mongolia-born Yokozuna Asashoryu, who just won his 17th career title in July at the Nagoya Grand Sumo Tournament, received a warm welcome from dozens of Japanese expatriates and Taiwanese supporters when he appeared at Chiang Kai-shek International Airport along with other wrestlers.
