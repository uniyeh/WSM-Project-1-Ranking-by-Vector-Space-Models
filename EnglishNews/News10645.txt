Appeasers selling India short NEW DELHI -- Belgian scholar Pierre Ryckmans coined the phrase the "100 percenters" to describe Beijing's international fans who support whatever China says 100 percent. Publishing under the pen name Simon Leys, Ryckmans compiled the statements of these toadies in defense of Chinese actions, including Mao Zedong's disastrous Great Leap Forward and Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and how the same sycophants later pitifully joined Beijing's denunciations of the very "successes" they had extolled. Today such hangers-on are trying to market China as a "near-superpower."
