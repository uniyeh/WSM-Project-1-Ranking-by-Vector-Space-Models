A test for Taiwan's democracy Ten days after Taiwan's presidential election yielded a contested result, there are signs of progress in resolving the political crisis it created. The winner of the vote, President Chen Shui-bian, last weekend promised a recount to defuse mounting tensions. The recount is a vital step in sorting out the situation, but it is not enough. The president must also promise a complete and public investigation into the assassination attempt that occurred the night before the ballot. Just as important is responsible behavior by the opposition Kuomintang Party (KMT). Its efforts to fan the flames of protest have only increased the spectacle in Taiwan politics. The party is not doing itself, or the Taiwanese people, any good.
