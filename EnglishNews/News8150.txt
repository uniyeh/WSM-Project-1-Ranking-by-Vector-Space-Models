Forget about a Taiwan alliance Regarding David Walther's Sept. 30 letter, "Getting Taiwan on Japan's side": As a Chinese student studying in Japan, my reaction to the dispute between Japan and China over the sovereignty of the Senkaku Islands is that Tokyo Gov. Shintaro Ishihara's recent stunt to have the metropolitan government purchase and develop the islands sabotaged the Japan-China relationship, ignoring the efforts for peace and mutual benefits made by the late Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping and Japanese politician Kakuei Tanaka not so long ago. It was wicked timing on Ishihara's part.
