Why is Japan refusing to pay UNESCO its dues? The Japanese government announced that it is withholding its payments owed to UNESCO. This is a $37 million expression of displeasure over the organization's decision last year to include a Chinese submission on "Documents of Nanjing Massacre" in the Memory of the World Register. It is also a warning shot aimed at the expected submission next month of a new "comfort women" dossier to UNESCO nominated by 15 organizations and institutions from 11 nations: South Korea, China, Taiwan, Japan, the Philippines, Indonesia, East Timor, the U.S., the U.K., the Netherlands and Australia.
