Japan shines at Asia's top film festival Acknowledged as the most important annual film event in Asia, Korea's Pusan International Film Festival (PIFF) opened its 13th edition on Oct. 2 under several clouds. The glittery opening ceremony, stuffed to the rafters with Korean celebrities, was more subdued this year owing to the same-day suicide of popular actress Choi Jin Shil â€” "Korea's Meg Ryan," as she was called. At the very least, Choi's death robbed the festival of many of its Korean entertainment journalists, who hurried back to Seoul from the southern port city in order to cover the tragedy.
