No resting on laurels in Asia SEOUL -- This is a remarkable moment in international relations. Despite a nuclear crisis on the Korean Peninsula, there are no doubts about the U.S. commitment to East Asia. Despite widespread criticism of U.S. policy, Washington currently enjoys "the best relations ever" with both Japan and China. This happy state of events is contrary to virtually every theory of politics and foreign affairs. Unfortunately, these halcyon days will not last. Unless Washington, Tokyo and Beijing muster the courage to tackle their fundamental issues and concerns, this will only prove to be a brief moment of convergence of national interests.
