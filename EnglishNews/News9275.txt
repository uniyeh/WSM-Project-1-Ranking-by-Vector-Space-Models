Taiwan slams ASDF chief, lauds his dismissal Taiwan's Foreign Ministry on Sunday panned comments made by the Air Self-Defense Force chief of staff but praised Japan for promptly sacking him after he said Japan was not an aggressor during World War II.
"The Foreign Ministry strongly condemns comments by a small number of people in Japan who ignore historical fact and rationalize Japanese aggression during World War II," the ministry said in a statement two days after Gen. Toshio Tamogami rebutted claims of wartime aggression in an essay for a contest.
