Inoue grabs wire-to-wire title Mayumi Inoue birdied two of the final three holes Sunday as she hung on to win the Promise Ladies golf tournament after a final-round 71 for her first career victory on the Japan LPGA tour.
Inoue, who began the day with a one-stroke advantage over five players, found herself even with Michiko Hattori and Taiwan's Huang Yu-chen through 15 holes before making back-to-back birdies from the 16th for a winning total of 5-under 211 at Tomisato Country Club.
