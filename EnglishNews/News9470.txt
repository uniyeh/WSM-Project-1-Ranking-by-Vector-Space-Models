Kawahara grabs one-stroke lead Yui Kawahara shot a 5-under 67 to take a one-stroke lead over South Korea's Bae Song Bo and Taiwan's Wei Yun-jye after the first round of the Accordia Golf Ladies on Friday. Kawahara, who has had three second-place finishes but yet to win on the Japan LPGA tour, made five birdies in a bogey-free round, including two on the last two holes, at Aoshima Golf Club. Bae, winner last week at the season-opening Daikin Orchid Ladies, maintained her momentum and had five birdies against a bogey while Wei made four birdies without a blemish on her scorecard. Mika Takushima, Yukari Baba, Midori Yoneyama and Taiwan's Yu Pei-lin shot 69s to tie for fourth.
