Mr. Chen faces more difficulties Taiwan President Chen Shui-bian has dodged yet another bullet. Unlike the failed assassination attempt during his last election campaign, this attack was metaphorical. His party defeated an impeachment vote in Taiwan's legislature, virtually ensuring that Mr. Chen will serve out his second four-year term as president. But damage has been done: Mr. Chen, who took power promising to clean up Taiwanese politics, has been badly hurt by allegations of corruption. His Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) is now severely handicapped for the next presidential election. It faces a test this weekend in mayoral elections in Taiwan's two largest cities, Taipei and Kaohsiung.
