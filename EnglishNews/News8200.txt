Fact welcomes a new face to the fold In September, Fact will embark on a monthlong Japan trek in support of their fourth full-length effort, January's "Burundanga." The gigs will be the Chiba posthardcore act's first domestic concerts since performing last December at the popular annual Countdown Japan yearend music festival. They will also be Fact's first local shows with their newest member, British guitarist Adam Graham.
