Myanmar's budding miracle More than three months ago, on April 21, amid great fanfare, Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda at a Japan-Mekong summit pledged $7.4 billion in development aid to five Southeast Asian nations in an effort to promote cooperation with countries in the Mekong region. The prime minister also said Japan would forgive $3.7 billion of Myanmar's debt as a way to support the democratic and economic reforms in Myanmar (aka Burma).
