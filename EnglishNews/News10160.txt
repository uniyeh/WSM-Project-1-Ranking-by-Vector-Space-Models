China berates Japan over expulsion of Taiwanese fishing boats Japan's expulsion of Taiwanese fishing boats from waters near a disputed group of islands in the East China Sea violates China's sovereignty, the Chinese Foreign Ministry announced late Thursday, having first lodged a complaint with the Japanese government.
"For Japan to forcibly expel Taiwanese fishermen doing common work in that ocean area is a violation of China's rights and sovereignty," Foreign Ministry spokesman Liu Jianchao said in a statement. "We ask that the Japanese side pay great attention to the Chinese side's concerns and practically, prudently handle the related problems."
