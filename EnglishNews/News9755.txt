More trouble in paradise For the fourth time in 19 years, the legal government of the South Pacific country of Fiji has been overthrown. The military is the culprit this time, with the head of the armed forces, Commodore Voreqe Bainimarama deposing Prime Minister Laisenia Qarase and his Cabinet. The coup has been roundly condemned and Fiji has been suspended from the Commonwealth. But the new government has been adamant that its predecessor was corrupt and would not be returned to power. Unfortunately, there are few options for concerned outsiders; punishment of the coup plotters is likely to hurt the Fijian people most and do little to restore a democratic government.
