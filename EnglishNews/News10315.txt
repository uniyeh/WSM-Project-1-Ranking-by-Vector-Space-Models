A nation that remains divided A lthough the final results, as in the 2000 election, will be delayed, U.S. President George W. Bush has won a second term in office. Democratic Sen. John Kerry could have dragged out the fight with legal challenges and demands for a recount, but he decided that the president's lead margin was too large to put the United States through such a trauma again. Now, Mr. Bush must -- as he pledged in 2000 -- find the common ground that will unite a divided country as it tackles important challenges in the next four years.
