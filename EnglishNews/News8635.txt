'Apart Together (Japanese title: Saikai no Shokutaku)' What do two people — once man and wife — do when they meet for the first time in over half a century? Answer: They sit down to eat. Or at least, that's the case in this carefully polished jewel of a film, "Apart Together" ("Saikai no Shokutaku" in Japan), which won the Silver Bear at the 2010 Berlin Film Festival. Here, eating together is an occasion to air emotions, savor conversations and steal looks at the face of a loved one. The mere act of pouring tea is charged with meaning, even eroticism, and the handling of chopsticks may signal a brief, private retreat down memory lane.
