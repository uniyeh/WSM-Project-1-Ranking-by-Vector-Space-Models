Recalling lady umpire Perry Barber and Cooperstown cookies Reader Dennis McCormick from Hyogo Prefecture recently wrote to ask, "Do you remember about 15 years ago an American woman umpire came to Japan and worked a few Japanese games in the Kansai area? I don't recall her name, but I was surprised when I found out she was not a regular umpire in one of the minor leagues in the U.S. Do you know whatever happened to her or even remember her being here?"
