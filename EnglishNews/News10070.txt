A binational prayer for reconciliation If any one programming section of the Pusan International Film Festival best represents its dedication to exploring every avenue of filmmaking, it's Wide Angle. This year, the section included more than 80 short subjects, documentaries and animated films. Seven of the feature-length Korean documentaries this year had connections to Japan. "Erotic Chaos Boy," for example, charted director Choi Jin Sung's own love affair with a Japanese woman who is also a documentary filmmaker. "NoGaDa" explored the way construction workers in both Japan and Korea are exploited.
