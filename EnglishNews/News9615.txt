Darvish to decide nationality Hokkaido Nippon Ham Fighters pitcher Yu Darvish, who holds both Iranian and Japanese citizenship, is set to choose Japanese nationality as he hopes to play for the Japanese team at next year's Beijing Olympics. According to his father Farsa, the 21-year-old right-hander is excited about the prospect of being selected to play for the Japanese national team in Beijing in 2008. Darvish, whose father is Iranian and mother Japanese, has already been named as a candidate to take part in the Asian regional qualifiers for the Beijing Games in Taiwan later this year. Japanese nationality law requires that a person holding dual citizenship must choose a single nationality before reaching the age of 22. Darvish will turn 22 on Aug. 16, 2008.
