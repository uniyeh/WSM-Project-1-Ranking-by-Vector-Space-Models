Democracy, Filipino style MANILA -- Before I moved to Manila two years ago, a Filipino parliamentarian told me about election-related violence in his country. At that time I could hardly believe my ears. Now I have come to understand that ballot snatching, intimidation of voters and even assassinations are a sad reality in many parts of the Philippines. According to official sources, more than 60 people have been killed and many more injured so far in violence related to the May 10 election.
