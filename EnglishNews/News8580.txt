Viewing wildlife through a lens I grew up in Britain, which is a crane-free zone, so from the very first time I  arrived in Japan I was dreaming of seeing the iconic red-crowned cranes of Hokkaido. How much more iconic as a crane can you get than being dubbed Grus japonensis? But just how was I to learn about their haunts and habits?
